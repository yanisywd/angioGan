# angioGan
Generative Adversarial Network for Angiography Image Synthesis

## Key Features:
- Utilizes Keras for building the generator and discriminator.
- Trains on grayscale images of 128x128 dimensions.
- Generates images from noise input.

## How to Run:
1. Ensure all required libraries are installed.
2. Adjust `folder_path` to point to your image directory for my case its a kaggle public dataset
3. Run the script to start training.
4. Generated images are saved in the `images` folder at specified intervals.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Keras
- pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
